# Arena Design Overview

## Changi Airport Terminal 1/Preliminary Arena Design

The layout of the arena was inspired by the departure hall of Changi Airport Terminal 1, particularly the area surrounding the FAST check-in zone and boarding access gates. This environment was selected as a reference due to its structured flow, open layout, and realistic operational constraints.

This design emulates a semi-structured, real-world indoor environment, with deliberate inclusion of tight paths, sensory triggers and blind spots. which provides the ideal conditions for testing:
  - Waypoint navigation,
  - Real-time SLAM (via RTAB-Map),
  - Path planning in dynamic obstacle scenarios.

## Arena Design Visualized with 3D Modeling

To support the physical planning and spatial validation of the robot navigation testbed, the preliminary 2D sketch was translated into a 3D model using SolidWorks.

## Finalize Arena Design

The final physical arena was constructed based on the initial conceptual layout and CAD visualization. It replicates a scaled-down version of a structured indoor environment â€” inspired by real-world airport terminals

  - Enclosed Room & Escalator Zone
    Simulates interactive or dynamic zones such as baggage screening or waiting lounges.

  - Pathways and Boundaries
    White boundaries help with LiDAR and depth sensor feedback, ensuring robust obstacle detection and wall-following     capabilities.
